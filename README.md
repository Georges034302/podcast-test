The [Trailer Viewer](https://georges034302.github.io/trailer-viewer/) is a information platform about movies generated from yaml data file.

You can find out more information about movies and cinema times/location in the Info section below.

The purpose of this project is to automatically generate XML data from raw YAML using Python script. 

The second part of this project is to use Docker (ubuntu) image to run commands to trigger GitHub Actions and automatically detect changes in the YAML data then transform the YAML to XML.
